## Code Quality
### Task 1: Introduction
 <a href='01%20Introduction/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='01%20Introduction/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Writing good code is not just about correct operation - code may compile and pass all of the tests, but may still be _badly_ written ! The aim of this workbook is to give you an appreciation of code _quality_ both in terms of how to assess it and how to improve it. View the slides and video above to gain an understanding of this general area. Then proceed with the tasks in this workbook in order to explore these areas in more detail.

There are no explicit practical activities for you to complete in this workbook. Rather, you should use the knowledge that you have gained from the material in each section to reflect upon your own programming practice. You should also consider how you might improve the "quality" of your code as you progress into future assignments.

### Task 2: Complexity
 <a href='02%20Complexity/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='02%20Complexity/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

View the slides and video above to gain an understanding of the nature and impact of code complexity. 
Some of the ideas might seem a little sophisticated, but don't worry, you won't be asked to calculate complexity values
(there are plenty of tools available that will do this for you).

Once you have an understanding of the nature of complexity, consider the code fragment shown below. The sample code loops through a folder of images and loads each in turn into a 2D array of pixels. The code then scans through all the pixels in this 2D array and replaces the colours found using a look-up table (consisting of a pair of arrays). 

``` java

String[] folderContent;      // Initialised elsewhere
Colour[] originalColours;    // Initialised elsewhere
Colour[] replacementColours; // Initialised elsewhere

for (String filename: folderContent) {
    if((filename.endswith(".jpg")) || (filename.endswith(".JPG")) || (filename.endswith(".png")) || (filename.endswith(".PNG"))) {
        Colour[][] pixelData = loadPixelData(filename);
        for(int x=0; x<pixelData.length ;x++) {
            for(int y=0; y<pixelData[0].length ;y++) {
                for(int i=0; i<originalColours.length ;i++) {
                    if(pixelData[x][y] == originalColours[i]) {
                        pixelData[x][y] = replacementColours[i];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        savePixelData(pixelData, filename);
    }
}

```

Even though the code is fairly short, a method containing this code would have a **Cyclomatic Complexity** of 10 and a **Depth-of-Nesting** of 6 (both very high values for such a short segment of code). Think about how you might _refactor_ this code to make this particular method _less complex_ and therefore _more readable_.  


**Hints & Tips:**  
Once you have some ideas about how you might go about refactoring the code,
hover your mouse over the buttons below to reveal some of our suggestions
and see if you agree with them...


<img src="answer.jpg" title="You could put the tests for image file extensions into a method called &quot;isImageFile&quot; ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
<img src="answer.jpg" title="What if you wrote a method called &quot;replaceAllPixels&quot; that took the 2D pixelData array as a parameter and did all the colour replacements for that entire image ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
<img src="answer.jpg" title="You could write a method called &quot;replaceSinglePixel&quot; that searched through the original colour array and then did a single replacement using the relevant colour from the replacement array" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
<img src="answer.jpg" title="You could write a method called &quot;getColourIndex&quot; that searched through the original colour array for a particular colour and returned the index value" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
<img src="answer.jpg" title="Using the pair of arrays for colour replacement is fairly ugly - you could use a better data structure for the lookup table (such as a hash map)" style="vertical-align:bottom" />

### Task 3: Good Naming
 <a href='03%20Good%20Naming/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='03%20Good%20Naming/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Something as simple as choosing "good" names for things can help greatly with the understandability of code. View the slides and video above in order to see a discussion on the nature of naming. With this discussion in mind, take a look at the following list of method names below and consider whether or not you think they are good names. Hover your mouse over the buttons to find out what we think of them !

- clone <img src="answer.jpg" title="This is OK - it's a bit short and only one word, but has a specific meaning within the Java language (so everyone should understand it)" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- sort <img src="answer.jpg" title="This isn't very good - sort what ? sort by which order ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- search <img src="answer.jpg" title="Borderline - the parameter name might hint at what attribute is being used for the search, but a longer method name would definitely help !" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- getArray <img src="answer.jpg" title="This is bad - which array ? what does it contain ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- readData <img src="answer.jpg" title="Again, not very good - what data is this ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- getLatestAdditionToResourceList <img src="answer.jpg" title="Perhaps a little too long - you can go too far !" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- doTheThing <img src="answer.jpg" title="Could this BE any vaguer ??? Both noun and verb are non-specific !!!" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- calcNumDist <img src="answer.jpg" title="Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity - would whole words really have hurt that much ? What is this - C ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- getpixeldata <img src="answer.jpg" title="No capitalisation ! Can make the name hard to read - and it breaks the Java style guidelines" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- sort_by_date <img src="answer.jpg" title="Underscores have no place in Java names (this isn't python !)" style="vertical-align:bottom" />

### Task 4: Replication
 <a href='04%20Replication/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='04%20Replication/video/segment-1_f.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Replication can have a big influence on the maintainability of code. View the slides and video above to find out about the nature and impact of replication. With the knowledge gained from the above, consider <a href="code/NaiveCalculator/NaiveCalculator.java" target="_blank">this naive implementation</a> of a command line calculator. It contains a lot of replication and inelegant code - see if you can identify any ways you might be able to factor out common code into a reusable methods (and by so doing avoid replication). Once you have some ideas on how you would do this, take a look at <a href="code/RefinedCalculator/RefinedCalculator.java" target="_blank" onclick="alert('You did at least *try* to come up with some improvements - right ? I mean, you didnt just click on this link to see the solution straight way ?\n\nNo, of course not - what WAS I thinking !\n\n\nP.S. You might need to enable pop-ups for this page to view the solution');">this more refined solution</a> as a possible approach for avoiding replication.

### Task 5: Structural Quality
 <a href='05%20Structural%20Quality/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='05%20Structural%20Quality/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

The overall structural organisation of a software system can also have a big impact on understandability and maintainability. Take a look at the slides and video linked to above relating to structural code quality. With the knowledge gained, review your current programming assignment. Issues of cohesion, coupling, dependency and global referencing are relevant to all types of programming (not just object oriention). You might, for example, wish to revisit one of your submissions from the C unit from the previous teaching block. It will be interesting to revisit your "old" code to see how your appreciation of structure has changed since last teaching block.  


# 
### Task 6: Code Decay
 <a href='06%20Code%20Decay/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='06%20Code%20Decay/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

The quality of code is always in flux and has a tendency to degrade over time (unless an effort is made to periodically reorganise and revise the codebase). View the slides and video relating to code decay and code refactoring.

It is hard to come up with a hands-on exercise for this task (since it addresses longer-term issues than can't really be covered in a small and compact activity). Issues of code decay may become directly relevant to your work later on in this unit (and in the programme in general). You may however like to revisit this section at that point for advice on refactoring.  


# 
### Task 7: Why you should care
 <a href='07%20Why%20you%20should%20care/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='07%20Why%20you%20should%20care/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

You might be wondering why we are so keen to impress on you the importance of code quality.  
View the slides and video to find out why !

From this point onwards, you will be expected to apply the code quality principles presented in this workbook. This not only includes your current assignment, but also in your future development work (both on this degree and beyond !).

For the remainder of assignments in this unit, you will be assess (at least in part) on the quality of your code - so be sure to apply these principles in your work.
