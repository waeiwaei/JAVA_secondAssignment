Something as simple as choosing "good" names for things can help greatly with the understandability of code. View the slides and video above in order to see a discussion on the nature of naming. With this discussion in mind, take a look at the following list of method names below and consider whether or not you think they are good names. Hover your mouse over the buttons to find out what we think of them !

- clone <img src="answer.jpg" title="This is OK - it's a bit short and only one word, but has a specific meaning within the Java language (so everyone should understand it)" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- sort <img src="answer.jpg" title="This isn't very good - sort what ? sort by which order ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- search <img src="answer.jpg" title="Borderline - the parameter name might hint at what attribute is being used for the search, but a longer method name would definitely help !" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- getArray <img src="answer.jpg" title="This is bad - which array ? what does it contain ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- readData <img src="answer.jpg" title="Again, not very good - what data is this ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- getLatestAdditionToResourceList <img src="answer.jpg" title="Perhaps a little too long - you can go too far !" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- doTheThing <img src="answer.jpg" title="Could this BE any vaguer ??? Both noun and verb are non-specific !!!" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- calcNumDist <img src="answer.jpg" title="Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity - would whole words really have hurt that much ? What is this - C ?" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- getpixeldata <img src="answer.jpg" title="No capitalisation ! Can make the name hard to read - and it breaks the Java style guidelines" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
- sort_by_date <img src="answer.jpg" title="Underscores have no place in Java names (this isn't python !)" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
