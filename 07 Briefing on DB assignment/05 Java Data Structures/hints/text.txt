In order to check that your code is successfully reading and writing data from the files,
you should alter the data _whilst it is in memory_ (i.e. _after_ you have read it in but _before_ you write it back out again).
You could for example replace the age of all people in the table with a randomly generated one. 
By changing the data in this way, you can check to make sure that the file system files are actually being over-written and updated !
