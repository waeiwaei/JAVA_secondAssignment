Now that you have a communication mechanism in place, we need something to transmit !
Clients will communicate with the server using a simplified version of the SQL database query language.
Your task is to write a handler for the incoming messages which will: parse the incoming command, perform the specified queries, update the data stored in the database and return an appropriate result to the client.

The query language we shall use for this purpose supports the following main types of query:

- USE: changes the database against which the following queries will be run
- CREATE: constructs a new database or table (depending on the provided parameters)
- INSERT: adds a new record (row) to an existing table
- SELECT: searches for records that match the given condition
- UPDATE: changes the existing data contained within a table
- ALTER: changes the structure (columns) of an existing table
- DELETE: removes records that match the given condition from an existing table
- DROP: removes a specified table from a database, or removes the entire database
- JOIN: performs an **inner** join on two tables (returning all permutations of all matching records)

A grammar that fully defines the simplified query language is provided in <a href="resources/BNF.txt" target="_blank">this BNF document</a>.
To help illustrate the use of the query language, we have also provided <a href="resources/example-transcript.docx" target="_blank">a transcript of example queries</a>.
You will note that BNF grammar contains two distinct types of rule:
- Symbols with angle brackets `<name>` denote rules which MAY contain arbitrary additional whitespace 
- Symbols with square brackets `[name]` indicate rules that can NOT contain additional whitespace

As a consequence of these rules, your server should be able to correctly parse incoming commands irrespective of the number of _additional_ whitespace
characters between certain tokens. So for example: 
<pre>SELECT    *  FROM     people  WHERE   Name  ==  'Steve' ;</pre>
is valid and acceptable, being equivalent to:
<pre>SELECT * FROM people WHERE Name=='Steve';</pre>

Dealing the such additional whitespace might seem like a daunting and challenging task.
Don't panic, we will provide you some help and advice in the lectures to deal with such queries.
