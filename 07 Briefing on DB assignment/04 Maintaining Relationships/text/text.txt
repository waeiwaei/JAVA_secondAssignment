Relationships between records in different tables should be recorded using **foreign keys**.
For example, the `PurchaserID` in the table illustrated below is a reference to the `id` of a person from the table in the previous task.
This additional data file is <a href="resources/sheds.tab" target="_blank">provided for you</a> in order to aid you in developing a solution.
You may assume only single element keys are to be used (i.e. you do not need to cope with "composite" keys).

Note that the `id` of a record should NOT change at any time during the operation of the system
(once a record has been assigned an `id` this will stay fixed for as long as that record is kept in the database).
You should not "recycle" IDs in any table (e.g. if rows are deleted) since they might be used as foreign keys elsewhere !

For simplicity, no primary or foreign key marker keywords are provided by the query language - the server relies upon programmer remembering which attributes are keys.

It is _not_ your responsibility to normalise the database - this is a job for developers who have designed the database schema and who make use of your database server. If you don't know what normalisation is, then don't worry - you don't need to know for this assignment (although I bet you are intrigued to find out now ;o)
